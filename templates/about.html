			<p class="card-text">
				The "Student Management System" is a sophisticated Full Stack project
				using CSS, HTML, MySQL, Python, and Flask, streamlining student-related
				tasks. With features like real-time updates and automation, it ensures
				efficient data management, enhancing collaboration in educational
				environments.

			<h3 class="card-subtitle mb-2">Project Overview</h3>
			<p class="card-text">
				Developed a comprehensive Student Management System as a Full-Stack
				Development (FSD) project with a strong emphasis on Database Management
				Systems (DBMS). The system integrated front-end and back-end components
				to facilitate efficient data entry, retrieval, and reporting for
				educational institutions. Employed technologies such as HTML, CSS,
				JavaScript, and a relational database (e.g., MySQL) for data storage and
				retrieval. The project showcased my proficiency in both front-end and
				back-end development, as well as effective DBMS design and
				implementation. Its success in enhancing efficiency and data management
				aligns with my goal to contribute technology-driven solutions in the
				education sector.
